## Introduction
This is the course descriptor for the Software Engineering course.

Software engineering 1 covers functors and monads, which are advanced patterns used to structure code in a composable way to solve a variety of problems in query-management, UI rendering, parallel processing, and more. The focus of the course will be on the patterns, and not on a pervasive philosophy of functional programming. These patterns are used in the practice of modern mainstream programming languages, from C# and Java to the JavaScript world. For this reason, we will build examples in TypeScript, a modern popular statically-typed variant of JavaScript with both a rich type system and broad appeal for professionals.

Thanks to this course, students will understand advanced patterns and the important principle of composition at a higher level of abstraction.


### Learning goals
The course has the following learning goals:
1. (FN) recognize and write functions and their composition;
1. (FR) recognize and write functors and their composition;
1. (MN) recognize and write monoids and their composition;
1. (MD) recognize and write monads and their composition.

The course, and therefore also the learning goals, are limited to **referentially transparent**, **type-safe** programs written in TypeScript.

The corresponding competences connected to these learning goals are: 
- realisation.

### Learning materials

The mandatory learning materials are:
- reader of the lectures, which will be made available one week after the lecture
- materials on the Github repository (github.com/hogeschool), which is already online


### Exam
The exam contains a series of questions about theory and practice. The questions are all based on Typescript snippets in the form of a series of five (10) *backward assignments*, that is exercises where students, given partial code implementing a function, composition, functor, monad, etc., are requested to fill in the missing code that matches the given specification. All constructs seen in class may be asked here.

#### Coverage matrix
There will be at least one question for each learning goal in each exam.

#### Scoring
Each questions is worth one point. The exam must score above 55%.


## Lecture plan
The course is made up of eight lectures, usually planned as one lecture per lesson week (for details, see lesson schedule on HINT). 

The lesson units covered by the course are the following:
- Types, functions, and their composition
- Functors, their implementation, and properties
- Monoids in set, monoids in programming
- Monads as monoids and (endo-) functors
- Very simple monads: Identity
- Sum monad(s): Plus, Exception, Option
- State monad
- Composition of monads: Coroutine


Note that each lesson unit does not necessarily correspond to one lesson week (for example, one lesson unit could span during two lesson weeks or two lesson units could be handled during one lesson week).


## Study points and contact time
The course awards students 8 ECTS, in correspondence with 224 hours of study.

The course consists of eight frontal lectures for the theory, and eight assisted practicums. The rest is self study.
