## Introduction
This is the course descriptor for the Software Engineering project.

The Software Engineering project covers a specific, practical use case of the topics learned during the minor.

Thanks to this project, students will understand how to apply advanced patterns and the important principle of composition in a practical framework.


### Learning goals
The project has the following learning goals:
1. (`IComponent<o>`) define a functorial React component
1. (`fromJSX`) define the monadic constructor from JSX elements
1. (`fromPromise`) define the monadic constructor from a `Promise`
1. (`race`) define the monoidal sum
1. (`all`) define the monoidal product
1. (`apply`) define a small web application in React that uses all the above learning components

The course, and therefore also the learning goals, are limited to **referentially transparent**, **type-safe** programs written in TypeScript.

The corresponding competences connected to these learning goals are: 
- realisation.

### Grading
The project is individual.
Grading the project consist of the deletion of one piece of code for each learning goal. The student must be able to reconstruct the relevant piece of code correctly.

#### Coverage matrix
There will be at least one question for each learning goal for each grading moment.

#### Scoring
Each questions is worth one point. The exam must score above 55%.


## Lecture plan
The project is supported by the practicums of both Software Engineering 1 and Software Engineering 2.


## Study points and contact time
The project awards students 14 ECTS, in correspondence with 392 hours of study.

The project is all self study.
